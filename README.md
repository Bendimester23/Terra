# Terra

Terra is an incredibly powerful free & open-source data-driven, platform-agnostic world generator. It allows you to create a world exactly
to your specifications, with no knowledge of Java required.

## Downloads:

* Paper+ servers (Paper, Tuinity, Purpur, etc): [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/85151/)
* Fabric: [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/terra) / [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terra-world-generator)

## Building and running Terra

To build, simply run `./gradlew build` (`gradlew.bat build` on Windows). This will produce a jar in `build/libs`
called `Terra-[CURRENT VERSION].jar`. You can put this right into your plugins dir, along with the correct Gaea version.

If you would like to test it with a default server config, just run `./gradlew setupServer` or
`./gradlew.bat setupServer` to set up the server, then `./gradlew testWithPaper` or `gradlew.bat testWithPaper` to run the server. If you
want a clean installation of the server, re-run the `setupServer` task. This will download a default server config
from [here](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/WorldGenTestServer)
and install the server in the `target/server` directory, along with all the needed plugins.

**Note: You will need to adjust the `NAME` variable `bukkit.yml` of the test server if you are not using the default Terra config.**
